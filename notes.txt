Reusability:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Workbox setup is a reusable template. Copy it to any static app and it’ll work the same as long as the paths and scope match.

What to keep the same

Put sw.js next to index.html of that app (the SW’s scope is its folder and below).

Keep sw-register.js loading ./sw.js.

Use relative URLs (./...) in:

index.html (manifest, icons, sw-register)

manifest.webmanifest (icons, start_url: ".")

Leave HTML/CSS/JS off the precache (we’re using NetworkFirst for instant updates).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changegments for each app:

manifest.webmanifest: name, theme, icons.

offline.html: wording/design.

Any extra assets in the precache list (only stable files like icons/manifest/offline page).
